ðŸš€ IBM Sales Dashboard Visualization in Tableau ðŸš€
I'm excited to share a detailed Tableau dashboard I created to visualize key insights about the workforce at IBM across different departments and job roles! ðŸ“Š

This dashboard provides a breakdown of:
-> Gender Distribution: An overview of male and female employees in each department and job role.
-> Age Insights: The average age by department and position.
-> Monthly Income: Visualized average monthly income by department and role to spot income trends.
-> Employee Education: Categorized by fields such as Life Sciences, Medical, and Technical degrees.
-> Marital Status & Gender: A detailed view of the marital status distribution across genders.
-> Work Experience: Number of companies employees have worked for in different sectors.
-> Employee Count by Job Roles: Understand where the major workforce concentration is.

This dashboard offers IBM leaders a bird's eye view of employee demographics, income distribution, and workforce characteristics. Insights like these can be valuable in workforce planning, ensuring diversity, and developing data-driven strategies for growth.
